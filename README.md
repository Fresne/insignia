Hello, here's my new Icon Theme isn't finish, I have to do a lot of work but I want to share with you a beta version. This theme fits very well with [Faba Of Sam Hewitt](https://github.com/snwh/faba-icon-theme). I recommend you to download this theme too.

I enjoy this theme so much and hope it will be the case for you too.

###Installing

Place Insignia on .icons or /usr/share/icons

###Important

If you like my work, invite me out for some [ice cream](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=DZE89Z9SE5QSC). The work is large because there are many programs out there, help me to stay motivated. Consider a small donation please. [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=DZE89Z9SE5QSC) (you don't need a paypal account to use their services)

###Tips

Some icons can't be changed, so you have to do manually, an easy way is using [menulibre](https://launchpad.net/~menulibre-dev/+archive/devel)

You can do manually. with the command sudo gedid from the terminal. Exemple:

> sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/xchat.desktop

And change the line "Icon=" by the name of your Icon. Exemple:

> replace Icon=path/of/the/icon/icon-name.png by Icon=icon-name.png
