Hello, here's my new Icon Theme isn't finish, I have to do a lot of work but I want to share with you a beta version. This theme fits very well with [Faba Of Sam Hewitt](https://github.com/snwh/faba-icon-theme). I recommend you to download this theme.

I enjoy this theme so much and hope it will be the case for you too.

###Tips

Some icons can't be changed, so you have to do manually, an easy way is using [menulibre](https://launchpad.net/~menulibre-dev/+archive/devel)

You can do manually. with the command sudo gedit from the terminal. Exemple:

	$ sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/xchat.desktop

And change the line "Icon=" by the name of your Icon. Exemple:

replace:

	Icon=path/of/the/icon/icon_name.png 
    
by 

	Icon=your_icon_name.png
